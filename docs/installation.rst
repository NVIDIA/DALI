Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Execute the following command to install the latest DALI for specified CUDA version:

.. note::

  Please always use the latest version of pip available (at least >= 19.3) and update when possible by issuing `pip install --upgrade pip`

* for CUDA 10:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist nvidia-dali-cuda100

* for CUDA 11.0:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist nvidia-dali-cuda110

* for CUDA 11.1:

  .. note::
    CUDA 11.1 build uses CUDA toolkit enhanced compatibility. It is built with the latest CUDA 11.x
    toolkit while it can run on CUDA 11.0 capable drivers 450.80 or later. Using the newest driver may enable
    additional functionalities.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist nvidia-dali-cuda111

DALI TensorFlow plugin (nvidia-dali-tf-plugin)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

DALI doesn't contain prebuilt versions of the DALI TensorFlow plugin. It needs to be installed as a separate package
which will be built against the currently installed version of TensorFlow:

* for CUDA 10:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist nvidia-dali-tf-plugin-cuda100

* for CUDA 11.0:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist nvidia-dali-tf-plugin-cuda110

* for CUDA 11.1:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist nvidia-dali-tf-plugin-cuda111


Installing this package will install ``nvidia-dali-cudaXXX`` and its dependencies, if they are not already installed. The package ``tensorflow-gpu`` must be installed before attempting to install ``nvidia-dali-tf-plugin-cudaXXX``.

.. note::

  The packages ``nvidia-dali-tf-plugin-cudaXXX`` and ``nvidia-dali-cudaXXX`` should be in exactly the same version.
  Therefore, installing the latest ``nvidia-dali-tf-plugin-cudaXXX``, will replace any older ``nvidia-dali-cudaXXX`` version already installed.
  To work with older versions of DALI, provide the version explicitly to the ``pip install`` command.

For older versions of DALI (0.22 and lower), use the package `nvidia-dali`. The CUDA version can be selected by changing the pip index:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/cuda/9.0 nvidia-dali
    pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/cuda/9.0 nvidia-dali-tf-plugin

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/cuda/10.0 nvidia-dali
   pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/cuda/10.0 nvidia-dali-tf-plugin

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/cuda/11.0 nvidia-dali
   pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/cuda/11.0 nvidia-dali-tf-plugin

CUDA 9 build is provided up to DALI 0.22.0. CUDA 10 build is provided starting from DALI 0.8.0.
CUDA 11 build is provided starting from DALI 0.22.0.

Pre-built packages in Watson Machine Learing Community Edition
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. |wmlce link| replace:: **WML CE installation**
.. _wmlce link: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5SF7_1.6.1/navigation/wmlce_install.html

IBM publishes pre-built DALI packages as part of Watson Machine Learning Community Edition (WML CE). WML CE includes conda packages for both IBM Power and x86 systems. The initial release includes DALI 0.9 built against CUDA 10.1 and with TensorFlow support. Other versions may be added in the future. The WML CE conda channel also includes the CUDA prerequisites for DALI.

After installing conda and configuring the WML CE conda channel (see |wmlce link|_) you can install DALI:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda create -y -n my-dali-env python=3.6 dali

    $ conda activate my-dali-env

    (my-dali-env) $ conda list dali
    ...
    dali                      0.9             py36_666ce55_1094.g70c071f

Nightly and weekly release channels
-----------------------------------

.. note::

  While binaries available to download from nightly and weekly builds include most recent changes
  available in the GitHub some functionalities may not work or provide inferior performance comparing
  to the official releases. Those builds are meant for the early adopters seeking for the most recent
  version available and being ready to boldly go where no man has gone before.

.. note::

  It is recommended to uninstall regular DALI and TensorFlow plugin before installing nightly or weekly
  builds as they are installed in the same path

Nightly builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To access most recent nightly builds please use flowing release channel:

* for CUDA 10:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/nightly nvidia-dali-nightly-cuda100  nvidia-dali-tf-plugin-nightly-cuda100

* for CUDA 11.0:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/nightly nvidia-dali-nightly-cuda110 nvidia-dali-tf-plugin-nightly-cuda110

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/nightly nvidia-dali-nightly-cuda111 nvidia-dali-tf-plugin-nightly-cuda111


Weekly builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Also, there is a weekly release channel with more thorough testing. To access most recent weekly
builds please use flowing release channel:

* for CUDA 11:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/weekly nvidia-dali-weekly-cuda110 nvidia-dali-tf-plugin-weekly-cuda110
