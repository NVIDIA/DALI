 * @section intro Introduction
 * NVIDIA DALI (Data Loading Library) is broken into two mains parts. The first part
 * is a library of base primitives for data loading and augmentation. These are
 * organized in the source tree by what type of data they operate on.
 *
 * The second part is a high performance data Pipeline (@ref dali/pipeline). The pipeline 
 * is designed to be quite general and extensible.
 *
 * @section lib Library
 * The library is currently quite small, but the goal is to build up a set of primitives
 * used by the frameworks so that all frameworks have access to the same data augmentation
 * and data loading functions.
 *
 * @section pipe Pipeline
 * The Pipeline is the user-facing class that enables the construction and execution of
 * graphs of operations. Underneath, it makes use of a few core classes that provide
 * key services.
 *
 * @subsection graph Graph:
 * @ref dali::OpGraph @n
 *
 * @subsection exec Executors:
 * @ref dali::Executor @n
 * @ref dali::PipelinedExecutor @n
 * @ref dali::AsyncPipelinedExecutor @n
 * @ref dali::AsyncExecutor (WIP) @n
 *
 * @subsection ops Operators:
 * @ref dali::Operator @n
 *
 * @subsection data Data Storage:
 * @ref dali::Buffer<Backend> @n
 * @ref dali::TensorList<Backend> @n
 * @ref dali::Tensor<Backend> @n
 *
 * @subsection mem Memory Allocation:
 * @ref dali::CPUBackend @n
 * @ref dali::GPUBackend @n
 * @ref dali::AllocatorBase @n
 * @ref dali::CPUAllocator @n
 * @ref dali::GPUAllocator
 *
 * The Pipeline also has Python bindings that expose a much nicer API than the 
 * C++ Pipeline. See the examples in 'dali/benchmark'. All python code is under
 * the 'dali/python' directory.
