# Speech Commands Data Set v0.01

This is a set of one-second .wav audio files, each containing a single spoken
English word. These words are from a small set of commands, and are spoken by a
variety of different speakers. The audio files are organized into folders based
on the word they contain, and this data set is designed to help train simple
machine learning models.

## History

This is version 0.01 of the data set containing 64,727 audio files, released on
August 3rd 2017.
[Update April 11th 2018 - This is now superceded by a new version of the dataset 
with more audio clips and improved label quality, available at [http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.02.tar.gz](http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.02.tar.gz).
There is also now a research paper on this dataset at [https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03209](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03209).]
