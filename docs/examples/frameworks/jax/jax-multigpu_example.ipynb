If you haven't already done so it is best to start with single GPU example to better understand following content.

    "Again, we start with creating a pipeline definition function. The pipeline was slightly modified to support multiple GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the new arguments passed to `fn.readers.caffe2`: `num_shards` and `shard_id`. They are used to control sharding:\n",
    " - `num_shards` sets the total number of shards\n",
    " - `shard_id` tells the pipeline for which shard in the training it is responsible. \n",
    "\n",
    " Also, the `device_id` argument was removed from the decorator. Since we want these pipelines to run on different GPUs we will pass particular `device_id` in pipeline creation. Most often, `device_id` and `shard_id` will have the same value but it is not a requirement. In this example we want the total batch size to be the same as in the single GPU version. That is why we define `batch_size_per_gpu` as `batch_size // jax.device_count()`. Note, that if `batch_size` is not divisible by the number of devices this might require some adjustment to make sure all samples are used in every epoch of the training.\n",
