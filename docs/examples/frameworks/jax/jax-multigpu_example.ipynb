If you haven't already done so it is best to start with single GPU example to better understand following content. To learn how to run DALI iterator on multiple GPUs please refer to [Getting started with JAX and DALI](jax-getting_started.ipynb#Multiple-GPUs) notebook."

    "Again, we start with creating a pipeline definition function. The pipeline was slightly modified to support multiple GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the new arguments passed to `fn.readers.caffe2`: `num_shards` and `shard_id`. They are used to control sharding:\n",
    " - `num_shards` sets the total number of shards\n",
    " - `shard_id` tells the pipeline for which shard in the training it is responsible. \n",
    "\n",
    " Also, the `device_id` argument was removed from the decorator. Since we want these pipelines to run on different GPUs we will pass particular `device_id` in pipeline creation. Most often, `device_id` and `shard_id` will have the same value but it is not a requirement. In this example we want the total batch size to be the same as in the single GPU version. That is why we define `batch_size_per_gpu` as `batch_size // jax.device_count()`. Note, that if `batch_size` is not divisible by the number of devices this might require some adjustment to make sure all samples are used in every epoch of the training.\n",
