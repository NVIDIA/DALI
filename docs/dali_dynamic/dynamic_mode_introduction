**DALI Dynamic** extends NVIDIA DALI by introducing an imperative execution model with lazy evaluation.
It complements the existing graph-based pipeline execution, and its main goal is to enable seamless
integration into Python workflows. This results in easier debugging and opens a path to rapid 
prototyping of pre-processing pipelines.

Key features include:

- **Imperative programming with lazy execution**  
  In the original DALI execution model, operators were defined and executed within a static 
  pipeline graph. This often resulted in a steep learning curve, complex debugging, and 
  limited error visibility. DALI Dynamic introduces imperative programming with lazy operator 
  execution, aligning DALI more closely with standard Python workflows.  

- **Minimal performance overhead**  
  DALI Dynamic is designed to deliver performance that is close to graph-based pipelines, incurring 
  only marginal overhead.  

- **Batch processing support**  
  Batch processing remains a core concept in DALI. DALI Dynamic preserves this functionality and 
  introduces a dedicated API for batch-oriented workflows.  

- **Framework interoperability**  
  DALI Dynamic provides type conversion support for major deep learning frameworks, including 
  PyTorch, CuPy, JAX, and Numba.

.. note::

   DALI Dynamic does not replace the graph-based execution model. Instead, it provides 
   an alternative interface for a seamless Python experience. Prototyping and development 
   can be performed in DALI Dynamic using exactly the same operators as a pipeline mode
   and transition between the two modes is straightforward.
