Building Python Wheel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change directory (``cd``) into ``docker`` directory and run ``./build.sh``. If needed,
set the following environment variables:

* | CUDA_VERSION - CUDA toolkit version (11.8 and 12.1 are officially supported, 11.0,
    11.1, 11.2, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6, 11.7 and 12.0 are deprecated and may not work).
  | The default is ``12.1``. Thanks to CUDA extended compatibility mode, CUDA 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
    11.5, 11.6, 11.7 and 11.8 wheels are named as CUDA 11.0 because it can work with the CUDA 11.0 R450.x driver
    family. Same applies to CUDA 12.x. Please update to the latest recommended driver version in that family.
  | If the value of the CUDA_VERSION is prefixed with `.` then any value ``.XX.Y`` can be passed,
    the supported version check is suppressed, and the user needs to make sure that
    Dockerfile.cudaXXY.deps is present in the `docker/` directory.
* | NVIDIA_BUILD_ID - Custom ID of the build.
  | The default is ``1234``.
* | CREATE_WHL - Create a standalone wheel.
  | The default is ``YES``.
* | BUILD_TF_PLUGIN - Create a DALI TensorFlow plugin wheel as well.
  | The default is ``NO``.
* | PREBUILD_TF_PLUGINS - Whether to prebuild DALI TensorFlow plugin.
  | It should be used together
    with BUILD_TF_PLUGIN option. If both options are set to ``YES`` then DALI TensorFlow plugin
    package is built with prebuilt plugin binaries inside. If PREBUILD_TF_PLUGINS is set to
    ``NO`` then the wheel is still built but without prebuilding binaries - no prebuilt binaries
    are placed inside and the user needs to make sure that he has proper compiler version present
    (aligned with the one used to build present TensorFlow) so the plugin can be built during the
    installation of DALI TensorFlow plugin package. If is BUILD_TF_PLUGIN is set to ``NO``
    PREBUILD_TF_PLUGINS value is disregarded. The default is ``YES``.
* | CREATE_RUNNER - Create Docker image with cuDNN, CUDA and DALI installed inside.
  | It will create the ``Docker_run_cuda`` image, which needs to be run using |nvidia_docker|_
    and place the DALI wheel (and optionally the TensorFlow plugin if compiled) in the ``/opt/dali``
    directory.
  | The default is ``NO``.
* | PYVER - Python version used to create the runner image with DALI installed inside mentioned above.
  | The default is ``3.6``.
* DALI_BUILD_FLAVOR - adds a suffix to DALI package name and put a note about it in the whl package
  description, i.e. `nightly` will result in the `nvidia-dali-nightly`
* | CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - build type, available options: Debug, DevDebug, Release, RelWithDebInfo.
  | The default is ``Release``.
* | STRIP_BINARY - when used with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE equal to Debug, DevDebug, or RelWithDebInfo it
    produces bare wheel binary without any debug information and the second one with \*_debug.whl
    name with this information included.
  | In the case of the other build configurations, these two wheels will be identical.
* | BUILD_INHOST - ask docker to mount source code instead of copying it.
  | Thank to that consecutive builds are resuing existing object files and are faster
    for the development. Uses $DALI_BUILD_DIR as a directory for build objects. The default is ``YES``.
* | REBUILD_BUILDERS - if builder docker images need to be rebuild or can be reused from
    the previous build.
  | The default is ``NO``.
* | DALI_BUILD_DIR - where DALI build should happen.
  | It matters only bit the in-tree build where user may provide different path for every
    python/CUDA version. The default is ``build-docker-${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}-${PYV}-${CUDA_VERSION}``.
* | ARCH - architecture that DALI is build for, x86_64 and aarch64
    (SBSA - Server Base System Architecture) are supported.
  | The default is ``x86_64``.
* | WHL_PLATFORM_NAME - the name of the Python wheel platform tag.
  | The default is ``manylinux2014_x86_64``.

It is worth to mention that build.sh should accept the same set of environment variables as the project CMake.

The recommended command line is:

.. code-block:: bash

  CUDA_VERSION=Z ./build.sh

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  CUDA_VERSION=11.1 ./build.sh

Will build CUDA 11.1 based DALI for Python 3 and place relevant Python wheel inside DALI_root/wheelhouse
The produced DALI wheel and TensorFlow Plugin are compatible with all Python versions supported by DALI.

DALI has several open-source dependencies. We keep them in two locations. First of all, the `main DALI repository <https://github.com/NVIDIA/DALI>`_ contains a ``third_party`` directory, which lists the source code based dependencies. Secondly, we maintain a `separate DALI_deps repository <https://github.com/NVIDIA/DALI_deps>`_, with the links to remaining dependencies. Please refer to the `DALI_deps README file <https://github.com/NVIDIA/DALI_deps/blob/main/README.rst>`_ for instructions, how to install the dependencies from that repository.

The SHA of the currently used version of DALI_deps can be found in DALI_PROJECT_ROOT/DALI_EXTRA_VERSION.

|nvjpeg link|_, |gds link|_, |jpegturbo link|_ and  |libtiff link|_ have an *unofficial* option to

Build DALI
^^^^^^^^^^

1. Get DALI source code:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/NVIDIA/DALI
  cd DALI

2. Create a directory for CMake-generated Makefiles. This will be the directory, that DALI's built in.

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir build
  cd build

3. Run CMake. For additional options you can pass to CMake, refer to :ref:`OptionalCmakeParamsAnchor`.

.. code-block:: bash

  cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

4. Build. You can use ``-j`` option to execute it in several threads

.. code-block:: bash

  make -j"$(nproc)"

.. _PythonBindingsAnchor:

Install Python Bindings
+++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to run DALI using Python API, you need to install Python bindings

.. code-block:: bash

    cd build
    pip install dali/python

.. note::

  Although you can create a wheel here by calling ``pip wheel dali/python``, we don't really recommend doing so. Such whl is not self-contained (doesn't have all the dependencies) and it will work only on the system where you built DALI bare-metal. To build a wheel that contains the dependencies and might be therefore used on other systems, follow :ref:`DockerBuilderAnchor`.

Verify the Build (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Obtain Test Data
++++++++++++++++

.. _DALI_extra_link: https://github.com/NVIDIA/DALI_extra#nvidia-dali

You can verify the build by running GTest and Nose tests. To do so, you'll need DALI_extra repository, which contains test data. To download it follow `DALI_extra README <https://github.com/NVIDIA/DALI_extra#nvidia-dali>`_. Keep in mind, that you need git-lfs to properly clone DALI_extra repo. To install git-lfs, follow `this tutorial <https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Tutorial>`_.


Set Test Data Path
++++++++++++++++++

DALI uses ``DALI_EXTRA_PATH`` environment variable to localize the test data. You can set it by invoking:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ export DALI_EXTRA_PATH=<path_to_DALI_extra>
  e.g. export DALI_EXTRA_PATH=/home/yourname/workspace/DALI_extra

Run Tests
+++++++++

DALI tests consist of 2 parts: C++ (GTest) and Python (usually Nose, but that's not always true). To run the tests there are convenient targets for Make, that you can run after building finished

.. code-block:: bash

  cd <path_to_DALI>/build
  make check-gtest check-python

Building DALI with Clang (Experimental)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

  This build is experimental. It is neither maintained nor tested. It is not guaranteed to work.
  We recommend using GCC for production builds.


.. code-block:: bash

  cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang  ..
  make -j"$(nproc)"

.. _OptionalCmakeParamsAnchor:

Optional CMake Build Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  ``BUILD_PYTHON`` - build Python bindings (default: ON)
-  ``BUILD_TEST`` - include building test suite (default: ON)
-  ``BUILD_BENCHMARK`` - include building benchmarks (default: ON)
-  ``BUILD_LMDB`` - build with support for LMDB (default: OFF)
-  ``BUILD_NVTX`` - build with NVTX profiling enabled (default: OFF)
-  ``BUILD_NVJPEG`` - build with ``nvJPEG`` support (default: ON)
-  ``BUILD_NVJPEG2K`` - build with ``nvJPEG2k`` support (default: OFF)
-  ``BUILD_LIBTIFF`` - build with ``libtiff`` support (default: ON)
-  ``BUILD_FFTS`` - build with ``ffts`` support (default: ON)
-  ``BUILD_CFITSIO`` - build with ``CFITSIO`` support (default: ON)
-  ``BUILD_LIBSND`` - build with libsnd support (default: ON)
-  ``BUILD_LIBTAR`` - build with libtar support (default: ON)
-  ``BUILD_NVOF`` - build with ``NVIDIA OPTICAL FLOW SDK`` support (default: ON)
-  ``BUILD_NVDEC`` - build with ``NVIDIA NVDEC`` support (default: ON)
-  ``BUILD_NVML`` - build with ``NVIDIA Management Library`` (``NVML``) support (default: ON)
-  ``BUILD_CUFILE`` - build with ``GPU Direct Storage support`` support (default: ON)
-  ``VERBOSE_LOGS`` - enables verbose loging in DALI. (default: OFF)
-  ``WERROR`` - treat all build warnings as errors (default: OFF)
-  ``BUILD_DALI_NODEPS`` - disables support for third party libraries that are normally expected to be available in the system

.. warning::

  Enabling this option effectively results in only the most basic parts of DALI to compile (C++ core and kernels libraries).
  It is useful when wanting to use DALI processing primitives (kernels) directly without the need to use DALI's executor infrastructure.

-  ``LINK_DRIVER`` - enables direct linking with driver libraries or an appropriate stub instead of dlopen
   it in the runtime (removes the requirement to have clang-python bindings available to generate the stubs)
-  ``BUILD_WITH_ASAN`` - build with ASAN support (default: OFF).
-  ``BUILD_WITH_LSAN`` - build with LSAN support (default: OFF).
-  ``BUILD_WITH_UBSAN`` - build with UBSAN support (default: OFF).

To run with sanitizers enabled issue:

.. code-block:: bash

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ASAN_OPTIONS=symbolize=1:protect_shadow_gap=0 ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH=$(shell which llvm-symbolizer)
  LD_PRELOAD=PATH_TO_LIB_ASAN/libasan.so.X PATH_TO_LIB_STDC/libstdc++.so.STDC_VERSION*PATH_TO_BINARY*

  Where X depends on used compiler version, for example GCC 10.x uses 6. Tested with GCC 10.2.1, CUDA 12.0
  and libasan.6. Any earlier version may not work.

  STDC_VERSION used by the system. Usually 6.

-  ``DALI_BUILD_FLAVOR`` - Allow to specify custom name sufix (i.e. 'nightly') for nvidia-dali whl package
-  *(Unofficial)* ``BUILD_JPEG_TURBO`` - build with ``libjpeg-turbo`` (default: ON)
-  *(Unofficial)* ``BUILD_LIBTIFF`` - build with ``libtiff`` (default: ON)

.. note::

   DALI release packages are built with the options listed above set to ON and NVTX turned OFF.
   Testing is done with the same configuration.
   We ensure that DALI compiles with all of those options turned OFF, but there may exist
   cross-dependencies between some of those features.

Following CMake parameters could be helpful in setting the right paths:

.. |libjpeg-turbo_cmake link| replace:: **libjpeg CMake docs page**
.. _libjpeg-turbo_cmake link: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.11/module/FindJPEG.html
.. |protobuf_cmake link| replace:: **protobuf CMake docs page**
.. _protobuf_cmake link: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.11/module/FindProtobuf.html

* FFMPEG_ROOT_DIR - path to installed FFmpeg
* NVJPEG_ROOT_DIR - where nvJPEG can be found (from CUDA 10.0 it is shipped with the CUDA toolkit so this option is not needed there)
* libjpeg-turbo options can be obtained from |libjpeg-turbo_cmake link|_
* protobuf options can be obtained from |protobuf_cmake link|_

.. _jetson build:

Cross-compiling for aarch64 Jetson Linux (Docker)
-------------------------------------------------

.. note::

  Support for aarch64 Jetson Linux platform is experimental. Some of the features are available only for
  x86-64 target and they are turned off in this build.

Build the aarch64 Jetson Linux Build Container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    docker build -t nvidia/dali:builder_aarch64-linux -f docker/Dockerfile.build.aarch64-linux .

Compile
^^^^^^^
From the root of the DALI source tree

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -v $(pwd):/dali nvidia/dali:builder_aarch64-linux

The relevant python wheel will be in ``dali_root_dir/wheelhouse``
