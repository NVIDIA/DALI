MXNet
=====

.. note::
   DALI 1.39 is the last release that will officially support the MXNet framework.

   Due to the MXNet project being `retired for a while now <https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.9.1/>`__
   DALI decided to stop supporting it. It means:

   - removal of corresponding examples
   - removal of the plugin itself
   - removal of test related to MXNet

   If you still using MXNet please install DALI that is not newer than 1.39.
