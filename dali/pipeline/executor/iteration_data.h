 * mentioned above. Using the provided API, user will be able to retrieve this information after
 * the iteration ends - at the same time when he's able to access outputs from the pipeline.
 *
 * @see daliGetOperatorTrace, daliGetNumOperatorTraces
 *
 * Here are few examples of these traces, but essentially sky is the limit:
 *   - "execution_time" -> "432 sec"
 *   - "number_of_unprocessed_samples" -> "100"
 *   - "next_batch_ready" -> "true"
