/**
 * CachingList differs from std::List by the ability to recycle empty elements. When allocating
 * memory is expensive it is better to store already allocated but no longer needed element in the
 * list of the free elements, than to free the memory and allocate it again later. CachingList
 * supports the following operations:
 * - GetEmpty moves an empty element of type T, either allocate it or use one from the free list
 * - PopFront moves the element from the front and removes it from the full list, the behavior
 * is undefined when the list is empty
 * - Recycle moves passed element to the free list
 * - PushBack moves element to the full list
 * - IsEmpty checks if the full list is empty
 * All functions operate on one element list as transferring elements between list is a very low
 * cost operation, which doesn't involve any memory allocation, while adding an element to the list
 * requires allocation of the memory for the storage in the list.
 *
 * Additionally, CachingList has a Prophet feature. This is an unidirectional iterator,
 * that travels over the data (asynchronously w.r.t. current Front and Back). The Prophet
 * allows to peek a list element and maintains the order even when elements are Pushed
 * and Popped in/out.
 * Use PeekProphet() and AdvanceProphet() to control the prophet.
 * In case there's an illegal access to the list, std::out_of_range will be thrown.
