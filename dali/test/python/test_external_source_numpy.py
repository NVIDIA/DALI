# it is enough to just import all functions from test_internals_operator_external_source
# nose will query for the methods available and will run them
# the test_internals_operator_external_source is 99% the same for cupy and numpy tests
# so it is better to store everything in one file and just call `use_cupy` to switch
# between the default numpy and cupy
