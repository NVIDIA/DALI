""" Eager module implements eager versions of standard DALI operators.
There are 3 main types of eager operators:
    stateless: callable directly as functions. Example:
        >>> dali.experimental.eager.crop(input, crop=(5, 5))
    stateful: operators that require a state, used as method of the `rng_state`. Example:
        >>> rng_state = dali.experimental.eager.rng_state(seed=42)
        >>> rng_state.random.normal(shape=(10, 10), batch_size=8))
    iterators: reader operators as python iterables. Example:
        >>> for file, label in eager.readers.file(file_root=file_path, batch_size=8):
        ...     # file and label are batches of size 8 (TensorLists).
        ...     print(file)
Additionally eager implements:
    math operators - `dali.experimental.eager.math`. Example:
        >>> tl = dali.tensors.TensorListCPU(...)
        >>> dali.experimental.eager.math.sqrt(tl)
    direct arithmetic operators on TensorLists, enabled with `dali.experimental.eager.arithmetic`
        as context-manager or as function with global setting.
