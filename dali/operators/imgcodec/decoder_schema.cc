or simply do `pip install nvidia-nvimgcodec-cu${CUDA_MAJOR_VERSION}` where
CUDA_MAJOR_VERSION is your CUDA major version (e.g. 12).

The slice can be specified by proving the start and end coordinates, or start coordinates
and shape of the slice. Both coordinates and shapes can be provided in absolute or relative terms.

The slice arguments can be specified by the following named arguments:

#. ``start``: Slice start coordinates (absolute)
#. ``rel_start``: Slice start coordinates (relative)
#. ``end``: Slice end coordinates (absolute)
#. ``rel_end``: Slice end coordinates (relative)
#. ``shape``: Slice shape (absolute)
#. ``rel_shape``: Slice shape (relative)

The slice can be configured by providing start and end coordinates or start and shape.
Relative and absolute arguments can be mixed (for example, ``rel_start`` can be used with ``shape``)
as long as start and shape or end are uniquely defined.

Alternatively, two extra positional inputs can be provided, specifying ``anchor`` and ``shape``.
When using positional inputs, two extra boolean arguments ``normalized_anchor``/``normalized_shape``
can be used to specify the nature of the arguments provided. Using positional inputs for anchor
and shape is incompatible with the named arguments specified above.

The slice arguments should provide as many dimensions as specified by the ``axis_names`` or ``axes``
arguments.

By default, the :meth:`nvidia.dali.fn.decoders.image_slice` operator uses normalized coordinates
and "WH" order for the slice arguments.

When possible, the operator uses the ROI decoding, reducing the decoding time and memory consumption.
