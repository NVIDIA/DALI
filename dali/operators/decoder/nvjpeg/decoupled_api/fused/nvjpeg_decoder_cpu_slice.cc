R"code(This operator is the CPU stage of nvJPEGDecoder with fused Slicing, it is not supposed to be called separately.
It is automatically inserted during the pipeline creation.
Partially decode JPEG images using the nvJPEG library, with a cropping window of given size and anchor.
Inputs must be supplied as 3 tensors in a specific order: `encoded_data` containing encoded
image data, `begin` containing the starting pixel coordinates for the `crop` in `(x,y)`
format, and `size` containing the pixel dimensions of the `crop` in `(w,h)` format.
For both `begin` and `size`, coordinates must be in the interval `[0.0, 1.0]`.
Output of the decoder is in `HWC` ordering.)code")
