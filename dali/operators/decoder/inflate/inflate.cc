    .DocStr(R"code(Inflates/decompresses the input using specified decompression algorithm.

The input must be a 1D tensor of bytes (uint8). Passing the ``shape`` and ``dtype`` of the
decompressed samples is required.

Each input sample can either be a single compressed chunk or consist of multiple
compressed chunks that have the same shape and type when inflated, so that they can be
be merged into a single tensor where the outermost extent of the tensor corresponds
to the number of the chunks.

If the sample is comprised of multiple chunks, the ``chunk_offsets`` or ``chunk_sizes``
must be specified. In that case, the ``shape`` must describe the shape of a single inflated
(output) chunk. The number of the chunks will automatically be added as the outermost extent
to the output tensors.

For example, the following snippet presents decompression of a video-like sequences.
Each video sequence was deflated by, first, compressing each frame separately and then
concatenating compressed frames from the corresponding sequences.::
